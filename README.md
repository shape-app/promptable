- @[haleygelato](https://github.com/haleygelato): I came up with this idea because I was tired of scrolling through chat history just to find certain prompts I used before. And after spending time perfecting a prompt, there was no good place to save it. While I tried Google Docs and Notes, the process of highlighting the entire text for copying was just too slow and tedious. This app is designed to address those challenges.
